          During my work experience, I have had the opportunity to take on
          diverse roles and projects that have significantly enriched my
          skillset and knowledge in computer science. After completing two
          semesters of my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science program at Rice
          University, I interned at Nedd Technologies in Houston, Texas, where I
          developed an ESG platform from scratch. Prior to my time in the US, I
          worked for nearly two years as a Software Engineer at HSBC Technology
          India, designing and developing critical microservices and backend
          solutions that significantly improved data accessibility and
          operational efficiency. My contributions were recognized with the
          &quot;Star Performer&quot; Award in Q1, 2023. Currently, I have joined
          Ford Motor Company in the Advanced EV department, where I am
          contributing to full-stack projects and other internal initiatives.
          These varied experiences have been instrumental in shaping my career
          and fueling my passion for technology, particularly in distributed
          systems, full-stack development, and DevOps.
