          During my work experience, I have had the opportunity to take on
          diverse roles and projects that have significantly enriched my
          skillset and knowledge in computer science. After completing two
          semesters of my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science program at Rice
          University, I am currently interning at Nedd Technologies in Houston,
          Texas, where I am developing an ESG platform from scratch. Prior to my
          time in the US, I worked for nearly two years as a Software Engineer
          at HSBC Technology India, designing and developing critical
          microservices and backend solutions that significantly improved data
          accessibility and operational efficiency. My contributions were
          recognized with the 'Star Performer' Award in Q1, 2023. Additionally,
          during my undergraduate studies at Vishwakarma Institute of
          Technology, I interned at Optimum Data Analytics, working on a deep
          learning project for document classification. These varied experiences
          have been instrumental in shaping my career and fueling my passion for
          technology, particularly in distributed systems, full-stack
          development, and DevOps
